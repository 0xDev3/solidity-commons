{"schema":"../schema.json","tags":[],"name":"ProofOfHumanity","description":"ProofOfHumanity This contract is a curated registry for people. The users are identified by their address and can be added or removed through the request-challenge protocol. In order to challenge a registration request the challenger must provide one of the four reasons. New registration requests firstly should gain sufficient amount of vouches from other registered users and only after that they can be accepted or challenged. The users who vouched for submission that lost the challenge with the reason Duplicate or DoesNotExist would be penalized with optional fine or ban period. NOTE: This contract trusts that the Arbitrator is honest and will not reenter or modify its costs during a call. The arbitrator must support appeal
