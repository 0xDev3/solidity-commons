This method can be used to determine whether or not a token is supported as well as getting a rough estimate on how much gas is required to execute the trade given a set of interactions. One notable difference, is the simulation doesn't actually require an order. This makes using this method inaccurate for predicting gas usage for specific trades. However, seeing as computing trade executions is completely independent of external contracts (i.e. it does not depend on the tokens being traded or the interactions being executed) the gas consumption should be off by a predicatable amount.","parameterDecorators":[{"name":"trade","description":"The trade to simulate.","recommendedTypes":[],"parameters":[{"name":"owner","description":"","type":"address"},{"name":"receiver","description":"","type":"address"},{"name":"sellToken","description":"","type":"address"},{"name":"buyToken","description":"","type":"address"},{"name":"sellAmount","description":"","type":"uint256"},{"name":"buyAmount","description":"","type":"uint256"},{"name":"sellTokenBalance","description":"","type":"bytes32"},{"name":"buyTokenBalance","description":"","type":"bytes32"}]},{"name":"interactions","description":"A set of interactions to settle the trade against.","recommendedTypes":[],"parameters":[{"name":"target","description":"","type":"address"},{"name":"value","description":"","type":"uint256"},{"name":"callData","description":"","type":"bytes"}]}],"returnDecorators":[{"name":"result","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"solidityType":"tuple"}],"emittableEvents":[],"readOnly":false}]}
