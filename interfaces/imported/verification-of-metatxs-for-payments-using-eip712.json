{"schema":"../schema.json","tags":[],"name":"EIP712Verifier","description":"Verification of MetaTXs for Payments using EIP712. This contract implements the two verification functions for the two main structures required in the payment process, and defined in ISignableStructs: - PaymentInput: to start a payment process - AssetTransferResult: to let the operator confirm the success or failure of an asset transfer The implementation uses the code in draft-EIP712 by OpenZeppelin. Contracts that call the code provided in this contract are recommended to implement an upgrade pattern, in case that the EIP712 spec/code changes in the future.","eventDecorators":[],"functionDecorators":[{"signature":"verifyAssetTransferResult(tuple(bytes32,bool),bytes,address)","name":"verifyAssetTransferResult","description":"Verifies that the provided AssetTransferResult struct has been signed by the provided signer.","parameterDecorators":[{"name":"transferResult","description":"The provided AssetTransferResult struct.","recommendedTypes":[],"parameters":[{"name":"paymentId","description":"","type":"bytes32"},{"name":"wasSuccessful","description":"","type":"bool"}]},{"name":"signature","description":"The provided signature of the input struct.","recommendedTypes":[]},{"name":"signer","description":"The signer's address that we want to verify.","recommendedTypes":[]}],"returnDecorators":[{"name":"_0","description":"Returns true if the signature corresponds to the signer having signed the input struct.","recommendedTypes":[],"solidityType":"bool"}],"emittableEvents":[],"readOnly":true},{"signature":"verifyPayment(tuple(bytes32,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,address,address),bytes,address)","name":"verifyPayment","description":"Verifies that the provided PaymentInput struct has been signed by the provided signer.","parameterDecorators":[{"name":"payInput","description":"The provided PaymentInput struct.","recommendedTypes":[],"parameters":[{"name":"paymentId","description":"","type":"bytes32"},{"name":"amount","description":"","type":"uint256"},{"name":"feeBPS","description":"","type":"uint256"},{"name":"universeId","description":"","type":"uint256"},{"name":"deadline","description":"","type":"uint256"},{"name":"buyer","description":"","type":"address"},{"name":"seller","description":"","type":"address"}]},{"name":"signature","description":"The provided signature of the input struct.","recommendedTypes":[]},{"name":"signer","description":"The signer's address that we want to verify.","recommendedTypes":[]}],"returnDecorators":[{"name":"_0","description":"Returns true if the signature corresponds to the provided signer having signed the input struct.","recommendedTypes":[],"solidityType":"bool"}],"emittableEvents":[],"readOnly":true}]}
