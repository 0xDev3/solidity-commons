The unique array is generated in-place, with distinct elements overwriting duplicates. At the end of the algorithm, these values are transposed to a separate array with a length equal to the number of unique elements.","eventDecorators":[],"functionDecorators":[{"signature":"uniqueAddresses(address[])","name":"uniqueAddresses","description":"","parameterDecorators":[{"name":"input","description":"","recommendedTypes":[]}],"returnDecorators":[{"name":"ret","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"solidityType":"address[]"}],"emittableEvents":[],"readOnly":true}]}
