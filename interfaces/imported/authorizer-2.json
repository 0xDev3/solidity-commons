Users are allowed to perform actions if they have the role with the same identifier. In this sense, roles are not being truly used as such, since they each map to a single action identifier. This temporary implementation is expected to be replaced soon after launch by a more sophisticated one, able to manage permissions across multiple contracts and to natively handle timelocks.","eventDecorators":[{"signature":"RoleAdminChanged(bytes32,bytes32,bytes32)","name":"RoleAdminChanged","description":"","parameterDecorators":[{"name":"role","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"previousAdminRole","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"newAdminRole","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true}]},{"signature":"RoleGranted(bytes32,address,address,address)","name":"RoleGranted","description":"","parameterDecorators":[{"name":"role","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"account","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"sender","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"where","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":false}]},{"signature":"RoleGrantedGlobally(bytes32,address,address)","name":"RoleGrantedGlobally","description":"","parameterDecorators":[{"name":"role","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"account","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"sender","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true}]},{"signature":"RoleRevoked(bytes32,address,address,address)","name":"RoleRevoked","description":"","parameterDecorators":[{"name":"role","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"account","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"sender","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"where","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":false}]},{"signature":"RoleRevokedGlobally(bytes32,address,address)","name":"RoleRevokedGlobally","description":"","parameterDecorators":[{"name":"role","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"account","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true},{"name":"sender","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"indexed":true}]}],"functionDecorators":[{"signature":"DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE()","name":"DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE","description":"","parameterDecorators":[],"returnDecorators":[{"name":"param0","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"solidityType":"bytes32"}],"emittableEvents":[],"readOnly":true},{"signature":"GLOBAL_ROLE_ADMIN()","name":"GLOBAL_ROLE_ADMIN","description":"","parameterDecorators":[],"returnDecorators":[{"name":"param0","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"solidityType":"address"}],"emittableEvents":[],"readOnly":true},{"signature":"canPerform(bytes32,address,address)","name":"canPerform","description":"Returns true if `account` can perform the action described by `actionId` in the contract `where`.","parameterDecorators":[{"name":"actionId","description":"","recommendedTypes":[]},{"name":"account","description":"","recommendedTypes":[]},{"name":"where","description":"","recommendedTypes":[]}],"returnDecorators":[{"name":"param0","description":"","recommendedTypes":[],"solidityType":"bool"}],"emittableEvents":[],"readOnly":true},{"signature":"getRoleAdmin(bytes32)","name":"getRoleAdmin","description":"Returns the admin role that controls `role`.
