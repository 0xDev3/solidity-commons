  "description": "Fast withdrawal agent implementation. With the help of liquidity providers (LPs), exchange operators can convert any normal withdrawals into fast withdrawals. Fast withdrawals are a way for the owner to provide instant withdrawals for users with the help of a liquidity provider and conditional transfers. A fast withdrawal requires the non-trustless cooperation of 2 parties: - A liquidity provider which provides funds to users immediately onchain - The operator which will make sure the user has sufficient funds offchain so that the liquidity provider can be paid back. The operator also needs to process those withdrawals so that the liquidity provider receives its funds back. We require the fast withdrawals to be executed by the liquidity provider (as msg.sender) so that the liquidity provider can impose its own rules on how its funds are spent. This will inevitably need to be done in close cooperation with the operator, or by the operator itself using a smart contract where the liquidity provider enforces who, how and even if their funds can be used to facilitate the fast withdrawals. The liquidity provider can call `executeFastWithdrawals` to provide users immediately with funds onchain. This allows the security of the funds to be handled by any EOA or smart contract. Users that want to make use of this functionality have to authorize this contract as their agent.",
