# CONFIRMED OWNER

The ConfirmedOwner smart contract is an extension of the ConfirmedOwnerWithProposal contract and provides a simplified implementation for basic contract ownership functionality. It inherits the ownership transfer logic from ConfirmedOwnerWithProposal and sets the pending owner to zero, allowing for a straightforward transfer of ownership to a new address.
