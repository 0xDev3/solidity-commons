# CONFIRMED OWNER WITH PROPOSAL

The ConfirmedOwnerWithProposal contract is a smart contract that provides basic ownership functionality.
It allows the current owner to initiate a transfer of ownership to a new address, which is then confirmed by the recipient using the acceptOwnership function.
The contract emits events to notify of ownership transfer requests and successful ownership transfers.
The contract also includes access control, where certain functions can only be called by the owner.
